# Smith Kitchen Chronicles

A collection of favorite recipes from the Smith household and its friends.

This is a fully functional CRUD (Create | Read | Update | Delete) application built using React. The app allows users to manage their collection of recipes by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting recipes. Firebase serves as the backend, handling data storage and retrieval.

Features:

-   Multi-page layout:
    -   Main Recipe List Page
    -   Recipe Details Modal
    -   Recipe Creation & Editing Form
-   Users can:
    -   View a list of available recipes
    -   Click on a recipe to view details in a modal
    -   Add new recipes
    -   Edit existing recipes, with changes immediately reflected in the database
    -   Delete recipes after entering edit mode
-   The app automatically fetches and updates recipe data upon saving an edit or adding a new recipe, ensuring real-time updates.
