# Smith Kitchen Chronicles

A collection of favorite recipes from the Smith household and its friends.

This is a fully functional CRUD (Create | Read | Update | Delete) application built using React. The app allows users to manage their collection of recipes by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting recipes. Firebase serves as the backend, handling data storage and retrieval.
